                Some years ago I was struggling to grasp the concepts of Closures in javascript, so obviously like any
                self-respecting developer I went to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>. It is
                there that I've found this <b>GEM</b> that I want to share with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The topic of closures in javascript is one of those things that confuses most developers not familiar
                with either the language or the topic itself. Seeing as how most developers now-a-days actually meet
                this concept for the first time within the javascript, this doubles down on the issue. So, I have, like
                many before me, went down that road and on the road to discover found plent of answers, none of which
                <b>made any sense whatsoever!</b>
            </p>
            <h3>I mean... just look at this definition from the wikipedia:</h3>
            <pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5">
                In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for
                implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a
                closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping
                associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an
                enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was
                created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those captured variables
                through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside
                their scope.

            <p>
                How is any novice programmer to understand that? Half the words mean nothing to someone without deep
                knowledge of programing concepts. This is one of the main reasons, or at least I view it as such, why we
                find dirty and ugly code in the wilds today. People are not explained the proper concepts from the
                start.

                So let me ask you do you want to see how a proper explenation looks like for someone who doesn't
                understand things?

                DISCLAIMER: I mean obviously I could have used many more, but I feel that this satisfies the test
                criteria. I have three years of experiance as a front end developer, I am just going throught the course
                in order to check it off my list, whilst trying to make minimum breeching of what the course is suppose
                to be at every stage. Sometimes I just can't help it.
